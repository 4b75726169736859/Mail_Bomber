Mass mailing with a google account

To allow access, we need to set the "Less secure access to apps" settings in our Google account.
If two-step verification is enabled, we cannot use the less secure access.

Works with Python 3.8.6.

Make sure you have installed the libraries:
- smtplib
- sys
- time
- lorem
- colorama
